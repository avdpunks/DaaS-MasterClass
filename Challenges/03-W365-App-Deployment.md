# Challenege 3: Deploy application via Intune

## Introduction

As an IT-admin, one of the easiest ways to get started with Windows 365 is to create Cloud PCs with default gallery images of Windows 10/11 Enterprise. 

After provisioning, you can customize the user experience by using Intune to push apps to your usersâ€™ Cloud PCs. These images can include existing Windows client apps already in your Intune environment. Since these Cloud PC devices are enrolled in Intune, you can treat them like any other Windows device in your environment.

## Challenge

It is important that your users have Visual Studio Code installed.

## Success Criteria

1.	Visual Studio Code, with the name **App-PUNK[count]-YourAppName** is available as a new Windows application (Win32) in Intune.
2.  Application Visual Studio Code is assigned and installed on your Cloud PC.
