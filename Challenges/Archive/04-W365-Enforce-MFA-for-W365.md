# Challenege 4: Enforce MFA for Windows365

## Introduction

Conditional Access is the protection of regulated content in a system by requiring certain criteria to be met before granting access to the content. Conditional Access policies at their simplest are if-then statements. If a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action.

## Challenge

Create an conditional access policy for **your users** and ensure MFA is enforced when using the Windows 365 Client.

## Success Criteria
1.	A conditional access policy is created
2.  MFA is enforced when accessing Windows365 with the Windows365 Client.
3.  MFA is not enforced when accessing a Azure Virtual Desktop session host.
