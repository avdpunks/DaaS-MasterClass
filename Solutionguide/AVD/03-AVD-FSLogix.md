# Solutionguide 3: Enable FSLogix Profile Container

## Challenge

In this challenge, you'll learn how to:

- Setup and configure an Azure storage account for authentication using Microsoft Entra Kerberos
- Assign access permissions to an identity
- Create a profile container with FSLogix for your session hosts in your multi-session Hostpool 

> **Note**: Hybrid identities are needed for this challenge. The users and groups must come from a traditional Active Directory domain.

### Task 1: Set up an Azure Storage account
- Setup an Azure Storage account and a File Share
- Enable Microsoft Entra Kerberos for Azure files
    
### Task 2: Assign access permissions to an identity
- AVD users will need access permissions to access the file share. You need to assign each user a role with the appropriate user access permissions

### Task 3: Create a profile container with FSLogix
In order to use profile containers, you'll need to configure FSLogix on your session host VMs. 

>**Note:** If you're using a custom image that doesn't have the FSLogix Agent already installed, follow the instructions in [Download and install FSLogix](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/fslogix/install-ht). 

>**Note:** The FSLogix agent is already installed on the Windows 10 or 11 Enterprise Multisession Gallery images provided by Microsoft.

- Enable FSLogix profile settings via a script or Intune if you like
- Delete local profiles when a VHD profile is applied
- Create a profile container with FSLogix during user login

## Success Criteria

- Storage Account and File share is setup correctly
- Microsoft Entra Kerberos is enabled on the File share
- Appropriate user access permissions are configured on the file share
- A profile container with FSLogix is successfully created 
- Check that your profiles are working as expected

## Task 1: Create a storage account
Azure file shares are deployed into storage accounts, which are top-level objects that represent a shared pool of storage. This pool of storage can be used to deploy multiple file shares.

Azure supports multiple types of storage accounts for different storage scenarios customers may have, but there are two main types of storage accounts for Azure Files. Which storage account type you need to create depends on whether you want to create a standard file share or a premium file share:

General purpose version 2 (GPv2) storage accounts: GPv2 storage accounts allow you to deploy Azure file shares on standard/hard disk-based (HDD-based) hardware. In addition to storing Azure file shares, GPv2 storage accounts can store other storage resources such as blob containers, queues, or tables. File shares can be deployed into the transaction optimized (default), hot, or cool tiers.

![Create Storage account](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_create-storage-account-0.png)

To create a storage account via the Azure portal, search for **Storage accounts** and select the resulting search result. This will lead to an overview page for storage accounts. 

Select **Create** to proceed with the storage account creation wizard.

FileStorage storage accounts: FileStorage storage accounts allow you to deploy Azure file shares on premium/solid-state disk-based (SSD-based) hardware. FileStorage accounts can only be used to store Azure file shares; no other storage resources (blob containers, queues, tables, etc.) can be deployed in a FileStorage account.

Create a general-purposev2 storage account with the following settings:
- Resource group: **select your Resource group**
- Storage account name: **fslogixprofilefs (or something similar)**
- Region: **North Europe**
- Performance: **Standard**
- File share billing: **Pas-as-you-go file shares**
- Redundancy: **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**
- Click **Review** and then **Create**

> Note: The advanced, Networking, Data protection and Encryption settings we don't need to change anything as we choose default settings

![Create Storage account](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_create-storage-account-1.png)

The storage account is created. Now navigate to the section **Data storage** and select **File shares**.
Click on **+ File share** on the top.

![Create Storage account](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_create-storage-account-2.png)

![Create Storage account](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_create-storage-account-3.png)

Create a file share with the following specs:
- Name: **profiles (or something similar)**
- Tier: **Transaction optimized**
- Click **create**

Click on **Next:Backup** and please deactivate the Azure backup functionality.

![Create Storage account](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_create-storage-account-3-1.png)

Next, **Review + create** to create the Azure file share. 

> Note: To use SMB protocol with this share, you need to check if you can communicate over port 445. [Script for Windows Client](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-files-samples/tree/master/AzFileDiagnostics/Windows)

When the file share is created, navigate to File shares in your Storage account. Beneath File share settings, click on **Active directory: Not configured**.
We need to enable Identity-based access for the file share in this storage account.

![Create Storage account](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_create-storage-account-6.png)

As we are using Microsoft Entra ID Kerberos in this Microhack, click on **Azure AD Kerberos**.

![Create Storage account](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_create-storage-account-7.png)

**Click on the check-box** to enable Azure AD Kerberos for this file share. 
To configure directory and file level permissions through Windows File explorer, you also need to specify domain name and domain GUID for your on-premises AD. 
You can get this information from your domain admin or from an on-premises AD-joined client. If you prefer to configure using icacls, this step is not required. 

![Create Storage account](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_create-storage-account-8.png)

Now comes a very important step for which you need at least the **Cloud Application Administrator** role for your tenant. You could also ask a **Global Admin** within your organization to perform this one-time task to finish the Azure AD Kerberos setup.

Navigate to the **App Registrations** in the **Azure AD** management overview. Switch to **All Applications** and find an app registration which starts with **[Storage Account]Storageaccountname.file.core.windows.net**.

![Create Storage account](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_create-storage-account-16.png)

Click on **API permissions** an then on **Grant adminconsent for directoryname**. Verify that the status column changes to **Granted for directoyname**.

### Task 2: Assign access permissions to an identity

Other users will need access permissions to access your file share. To do this, you'll need to assign each user a role with the appropriate access permissions.

To assign users access permissions:

- From the Azure portal, **open the file share you created** in Set up an Azure Storage account
- Select **Access Control (IAM)**
- Select **Add a role assignment**

![Create Storage account](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_create-storage-account-10.png)

- In the Add role assignment tab, select the appropriate built-in role from the role list. 

  You'll need to at least **select Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor** for the account to get proper permissions.

![Create Storage account](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_create-storage-account-11.png)

- For Assign access to, select **Microsoft Entra ID user, group, or service principal**.
- **Select a name or email address for the target Microsoft Entra ID identity**.
- Select **Save**.

![Create Storage account](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_create-storage-account-12.png)

Click on **Review + assign**

> ðŸ’¡To setup FSLogix on the session Hosts, you need to upload the setupFSLogix.ps1 into a Container in your Storage Account
[Custom Script Extension Setup FSLogix](../Sources/setupFSLogix.ps1)

- Navigate to **your Storage Account** 
- Select **Containers**
- Click on **+ Container**, choose a name for the Container (in our case, we selected cse for custom script extension)
- Public access level: **private**

![Custom Script Extension](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_customscriptextension-1.png)

- **Select your recently created Container**
- **Upload the setupFSLogix.ps1** as shown in the screenshot above

![Custom Script Extension](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_customscriptextension-2.png)

- Navigate to your Virtual machine (from your multi-session Hostpool)
- On the left side beneath **Settings**, select **Extensions + applications**
- Click on **Add**

![Custom Script Extension](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_customscriptextension-3.png)

- Select **Custom Script Extension**

![Custom Script Extension](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_customscriptextension-4.png)

- For the **script file**, search for the script **setupFSLogix.ps1** in your container.
- Arguments: type the **UNC Path of your fileshare**, e. g. \\uniquesamicroh.file.core.windows.net\fslogixfs
- Click on **Review + create**

![Custom Script Extension](../../Images/SolutionGuide/AVD/03-FSLogix_customscriptextension-5.png)

Now FSLogix will be set up using the Azure File share for user profiles. You should now be able to test with both user accounts, if the profile is created correctly on your fileshare.
